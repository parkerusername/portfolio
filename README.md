How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The only way to implement solutions to user needs is to break them down into actionable tasks. User stories are just one
way to do this. By breaking these problems down into small tasks, it's possible to solve almost any issue, no matter the scale.



How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I generally start by opening either google docs or notepad, and writing out my pseudocode. I also take note of algorithms or techniques that could be
of use. After that I open a code editor, I being by coding any classes I need and declaring methods I'll use, with whatever parameters they'll need.
Actually writng the code comes last, and I'll generally iterate over it until I'm satisfied with the result.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I'd say, the most valuabel things to me personally, is communication and transparency. I want to know what someones doing, what they need to move forward,
and how I can help them. That's most important thing to being a team member, and will ensure high quality work.
